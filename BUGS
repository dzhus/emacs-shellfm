* TODO Unable to get station info
  As of February 1, 2009, console `shell-fm(1)` program is unable to
  properly show station name, displaying broken `Receiving .` message
  instead. Emacs interface therefore can't switch to «playing» mode,
  making it impossible to get station name and current track info,
  showing only «Not available».
  
  It happens because XSPF provided by Last.fm for radio stations lacks
  proper `<title></title>` contents. So this is not a bug in
  emacs-shellfm or `shell-fm(1)`, but a Last.fm issue.
