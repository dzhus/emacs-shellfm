* Prerequisites
  Make sure you've got fresh Shell-fm *working* installation (checked
  with git version 24-06-2008). This package will fail to work
  otherwise, because it relies on `-b` option added to Shell-FM.
* Installation
  Unpack emacs-shellfm tarball.

  Type `make recompile` to byte-compile `.el` files.

  Add the following to your `~/.emacs.el` file:

      (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/emacs-shellfm/directory")
      (require 'shellfm)

  Reload your `~/.emacs.el`. Customize `shellfm` options group.
* Using emacs-shellfm
** Launching Shell-FM
   You may call `shellfm` function which will start Shell-FM
   subprocess and tune to default Last.fm radio provided you've
   specified one in `lastfm-default-url` customization variable.
   
** Shell-FM functions
   You may see all the Shell-FM functions by typing `C-h a shellfm`.

   You may stop listening using `shellfm-pause` or `shellfm-stop`.
   Kill Shell-FM using `shellfm-kill` function.
   
** Tips
   In case you have keyboard with additional multimedia keys, it may
   be cool to bind them all to `shellfm-` functions.

   Here's a binding I use (launch Shell-FM unless it's not yet running
   or skip current track otherwise):

       (global-set-key (kbd "<XF86AudioPlay>")
                    (lambda () (interactive)
                      (if (shellfm-running-p)
                          (shellfm-skip-track)
                        (shellfm 1))))
* Known issues
** Login data
   Emacs-shellfm won't work correctly unless you set up your Last.fm
   login and password in `~/.shell-fm/shell-fm.rc`.
   
** np-file-pormat
   Please note that emacs-shellfm may not work properly if you
   changed `np-file-format` option in your `shell-fm.rc` (so you may
   not see the track duration or remaining seconds of the played
   track).
