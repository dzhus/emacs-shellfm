* Dev notes
** Package structure
   A package provides Emacs Lisp interface to control shell-fm (console
   Last.fm player) subprocess
*** User functions
    Sending commands to shell-fm subprocess.
*** DONE [#A] Parsing shell-fm output
    CLOSED: [2008-01-05 Сбт 23:20]
    Filter function should inform user about shell-fm status
** [100%] «Robustness» :-)
   - [1/1] Handle unexpected shell-fm output
     - [X] Unset login/password
   - [X] Unset Last.fm username
         Emacs-shellfm extracts account name from `shell-fm.rc` which
         is guaranteed to be correct as `shell-fm(1)` uses this data
         to connect to the Last.fm servers
** TODO Keybindings
** [1/2] «Nifties»
   - [ ] modeline lighter
   - [X] rich format status messages
** DONE Shell.FM global menu
** TODO [#D] Minor mode
   Probably emacs-shellfm should act like a minor mode.
   [[info:elisp:Minor%20Mode%20Conventions][elisp:Minor Mode Conventions]]
** TODO Nondefault `np-file-format` value handling
   Currently emacs-shellfm is unaware of `np-file-format` changes in
   `shell-fm.rc`.

   Probably the package should somehow get all available track
   information, mapping `shell-fm(1)` output into elisp variables for
   further processing and using (i. e. in `shellfm-track-info`
   function). Ways to achieve this are:

   1. Use network interface `info` command. Cons: second interaction
      level in addition to subprocess textual exchange.
   2. Override `np-file-format` option when launching `shell-fm(1)` to
      "%a;%t;%l%d;%s;%R".
   3. Allow customization of the `shellfm-nowplaying-regexp` variable.

*** DONE getopt+shell-fm is nasty with command line options:
    CLOSED: [2008-01-04 Птн 19:29]
    `shell-fm -b ""` — yields «Bad lastfm:// URL» error. Fix: always
    pass some `lastfm://` URL to `shell-fm` process.
