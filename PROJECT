* Issues
** DONE getopt+shell-fm is nasty with command line options:
   CLOSED: [2008-01-04 Птн 19:29]
   `shell-fm -b ""` — yields «Bad lastfm:// URL» error. Fix: always
   pass some `lastfm://` URL to `shell-fm` process. 

* Manual
** Prerequisites
   Make sure you've got fresh Shell.fm installation (at least SVN 285).
** Installation
   Unpack emacs-shellfm tarball.

   Type `make recompile` to byte-compile `.el` files.

   Add the following to your `~/.emacs.el` file:

       (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/emacs-shellfm/directory")
       (require 'shellfm)

   Reload your `~/.emacs.el`. Customize `shellfm` group.
** Using emacs-shellfm
*** Launching Shell.FM
    You may call `shellfm` function which will start Shell.FM
    subprocess and tune to default Last.fm radio provided you've
    specified one in `lastfm-default-url` customization variable.
*** Shell.FM functions
    Then you may see all the Shell.FM functions by typing `C-h a
    shellfm`.

    You may stop listening using `shellfm-pause` or `shellfm-stop`.
    Kill Shell.FM using `shellfm-kill` function.
*** Tips
    In case you have keyboard with additional multimedia keys, it may
    be cool to bind them all to `shellfm-` functions.
